# Credit Score Classification with Machine Learning

Welcome to my Credit Score Classification project! In this project, I demonstrate my expertise in building and evaluating machine learning models to predict an individual's credit score with high accuracy, based on their financial history and personal information.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the credit score of an individual using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset used in this project is a simulated dataset of individuals and their credit scores.

## Project Workflow

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted EDA to gain insights into the data.
- Examined relationships between various features and the credit score.
- Visualized data distributions and feature correlations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling.
- Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature engineering.
- Scaled and transformed features to improve model performance.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Trained multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest.
- Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation results.

### Model Prediction and Visualization
- Used the selected model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- Evaluated the model's performance on this new data.
- Visualized results to gain additional insights into model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, among others
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Takeaways
- Demonstrated ability to work with real-world data and perform EDA.
- Showcased skills in data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models.
- Made informed decisions based on model evaluation metrics.
- Visualized results to enhance understanding of model performance.

## Conclusion
This project showcases my skills in the field of machine learning and data science. By predicting credit scores with high accuracy, I have demonstrated my ability to handle data, build and evaluate models, and make data-driven decisions. I believe this project will impress hiring managers and highlight my expertise in machine learning and data science.
